/**
 * ML DB schema.
 *
 * The "ML" database is made of the lower level "index" object stores, and
 * higher level "cluster" object stores.
 *
 * The index related object stores are the following:
 *
 * -   "file-status": Contains {@link FileStatus} objects, one for each
 *     {@link EnteFile} that the ML subsystem knows about. Periodically (and
 *     when required), this is synced with the list of files that the current
 *     client knows about locally.
 *
 * -   "face-index": Contains {@link LocalFaceIndex} objects, either indexed
 *     locally or fetched from remote.
 *
 * -   "clip-index": Contains {@link LocalCLIPIndex} objects, either indexed
 *     locally or fetched from remote.
 *
 * These three stores are keyed by {@link fileID}. The "file-status" contains
 * book-keeping about the indexing process (whether or not a file needs
 * indexing, or if there were errors doing so), while the other stores contain
 * the actual indexing results.
 *
 * In tandem, these serve as the underlying storage for the indexes maintained
 * in the ML database.
 *
 * The cluster related object stores are the following:
 *
 * -   "face-cluster": Contains {@link FaceCluster} objects, one for each
 *     cluster of faces that either the clustering algorithm produced locally or
 *     were synced from remote. It is indexed by the (cluster) ID.
 *
 * -   "cluster-group": Contains {@link CGroup} objects, one for each group of
 *     clusters that were synced from remote. The client can also locally
 *     generate cluster groups on certain user interactions, but these too will
 *     eventually get synced with remote. This object store is indexed by the
 *     (cgroup) ID.
