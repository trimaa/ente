/**
 * Register a keypair with the server and return a pairing code that can be used
 * to connect to us. Phase 1 of the pairing protocol.
 *
 * [Note: Pairing protocol]
 *
 * The Chromecast Framework (represented here by our handle to the Chromecast
 * Web SDK, {@link cast}) itself is used for only the initial handshake, none of
 * the data, even encrypted passes over it thereafter.
 *
 * The pairing happens in two phases:
 *
 * Phase 1 - {@link register}
 *
 * 1. We (the receiver) generate a public/private keypair. and register the
 *    public part of it with museum.
 *
 * 2. Museum gives us a pairing "code" in lieu. Show this on the screen.
 *
 * Phase 2 - {@link advertiseCode}
 *
 * There are two ways the client can connect - either by sending us a blank
 * message over the Chromecast protocol (to which we'll reply with the pairing
 * code), or by the user manually entering the pairing code on their screen.
 *
 * 3. Listen for incoming messages over the Chromecast connection.
 *
 * 4. The client (our Web or mobile app) will connect using the "sender"
 *    Chromecast SDK. This will result in a bi-directional channel between us
 *    ("receiver") and the Ente client app ("sender").
 *
 * 5. Thereafter, if at any time the sender disconnects, close the Chromecast
 *    context. This effectively shuts us down, causing the entire page to get
 *    reloaded.
 *
 * 6. After connecting, the sender sends an (empty) message. We reply by sending
 *    them a message containing the pairing code. This exchange is the only data
 *    that traverses over the Chromecast connection.
 *
 * Once the client gets the pairing code (via Chromecast or manual entry),
 * they'll let museum know. So in parallel with Phase 2, we perform Phase 3.
 *
 * Phase 3 - {@link getCastData} in a setInterval.
 *
 * 7. Keep polling museum to ask it if anyone has claimed that code we vended
 *    out and used that to send us an payload encrypted using our public key.
 *
 * 8. When that happens, decrypt that data with our private key, and return this
 *    payload. It is a JSON object that contains the data we need to initiate a
 *    slideshow for a particular Ente collection.
 *
 * Phase 1 (Steps 1 and 2) are done by the {@link register} function, which
 * returns a {@link Registration}.
 *
 * At this time we start showing the pairing code on the UI, and start phase 2,
 * {@link advertiseCode} to vend out the pairing code to Chromecast connections.
 *
 * In parallel, we start Phase 3, calling {@link getCastData} in a loop. Once we
 * get a response, we decrypt it to get the data we need to start the slideshow.
